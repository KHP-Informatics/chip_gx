Make Phenotype and technical/batch information files


Lumi Processing

    Read in raw gene expression data using lumiR

    Add phenotype and any other technical iformation to the pData() slot

    Add any extra feature (probe data) data to the fData() slot

    Determine and/or add the following data/colums to the pData() slot:- GROUPS,PHENOTYPE,GENDER,TISSUE,RIN,RNA_YIELD,DATE****

    QC plots of raw data & save RData & write data to flat file, exps, se.exprs, detection, beadnum,feature data

    Id outlier samples based on intensity level data and remove

    Check Sex based on XIST gene. Flag samples that dont match

    Id probes that can be detected. Options 1) Probe.chip > 2SD mean(NEGATIVE_CONTROL_BEADS.chip) or 2) detection pvalue <= 0.01

    lumiExpresso 1) VSN>RSN or 2) log2 > QN

    SampleNetworks to Id outlier samples based on inter-array adjacency. Do this by GROUPS. Iterate within each group until Z.K >= -2. GROUPS can be by disease, tissue, disease*tissue, processing batch etc etc. Usually I use disease*tissue.

    Remove bad samples. These are id'd from each iteration with sample GROUPS

    Test for association of gene expression PC with phenotypes & technical/batch qc information

    Use linear model to correct for any technical or batch affects:-  adj_exp[probe_i] <- mean(probe_expression[probe_i],na.rm=TRUE) + as.numeric( lm(probe_expression[probe_i] ~ RIN + DATE*** + YIELD, data=my_gene_exprs)$residuals )

    Test for association of gene expression PC with phenotypes & technical/batch qc information

    Creat final data :- good samples & detected probes

    Options for processing

	bg_rma
	bg_mb

	bg_vst_rsn*
	bg_vst_quantile*

	bg_log_rsn
	bg_log_quantile

	bg_vsn

On the one hand, data that was background normalized
(bg_*) tend to better reflect the real fold changes, i.e.
show less bias.
